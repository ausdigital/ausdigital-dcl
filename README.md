# Ausdigital Digital Capability Locator

The framework assumes that there could be multiple publishers of business meta-data and e-business capabilites.  Therefore a simple way to ask "where can I find information about the e-business capabilities of business X ?" is needed.  That is the purpose of the DCL.  It is essentially a DNS lookup (NAPTR Record) using a business identifier (eg ABN) as the query and it returns the URL of the detailed metadata about that business.  In a given economy, there is usually only one DCL - often operated by a government authority.
